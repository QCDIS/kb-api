      "During the past ten years new technologies have remarkably extended the scope of marine research and now offer exciting novel perspectives for pioneering research. Unmanned underwater vehicles have reached a high degree of reliability and they develop towards standard equipment on modern research vessels. However, the technical complexity of the systems and their integrated scientific payload is a challenge for both the operational team and the scientists. This is addressed through proposed dedicated training courses to enable the next generation of marine researchers to fully utilize the possibilities offered by this kind of scientific instrumentation onboard European research vessels.",

      "To date, the SeaDataNet CDI metadata format for describing observation data sets use was made of the L05 vocabulary to indicate the device categories class of instruments used for acquiring the observations. As part of the ENVRIFAIR project, aiming at making data management services more FAIR, an expansion was made to be able to include also the specific type of instruments, such as e.g. SeaBird SBE 21. In this way, there is additional information available for making a better judgement on the quality of the data, useful for data centres performing QAQC on the data, and for endusers. This expansion is done by adding the option for terms from the L22 vocabulary Device Catalogue. The information for the CDI can be retrieved from the SensorML records that are being used as part of the SWE toolkit and this opens opportunities for Eurofleets+ as part of the EARS module to carry also the types of instruments as used on the research vessels.",
      "Eurofleets+ data management aims ultimately at publishing the metadata and data sets as collected by scientific teams during all the Eurofleets+ TNA cruises. This publishing is done through the EVIOR portal European Virtual Infrastructure in Ocean Research  integrated into the Eurofleets+ Website, and towards the larger community through inclusion in SeaDataNet and EMODnet portals and in a F.A.I.R. way. Therefore, the data management DM is deployed in synergy with SeaDataNet and its European network of NODCs. Scientific cruise teams formulate cruise DM plans for review by SDN NODCs HCMR, OGS, and RBINS, who coach each scientific team before, during, and after TA cruises. They arrange later validation and archival of cruise data sets by NODCs for long term stewardship, and publishing. Scientific teams can make use of EMODnet Ingestion for transfer of processed cruise data sets to the NODCs. ",
      "The Research Vessels are being equipped with EARS Eurofleets Automatic Reporting System to gather and transfer metadata during cruise, underway data from fixed sensors on board, and data acquisition events info. Among others, this facilitates production of the Cruise Summary Reports CSR which are published and made available at EVIOR soon after the cruises. The advanced version of the shipboard data management system has successively been piloted on board selected research vessels, and rolled out across the fleet to supported Eurofleets+ funded TNA. The functionalities of the EVIOR portal continue to be reviewed, improved and expanded, including providing researchers in a later project stage with unique cloud computing and analytical technologies for interacting with the collected research vessel metadata and data.",
      "There is a requirement to shorten the time period between data acquisition and data access for users on research vessels and on shore, as well as for interacting with crew and vessels from the shore. The ability to directly communicate from the shore with the ship, its crew, and its data acquisition operations, while sometimes at the other end of the world, will facilitate optimising the scientific output of these costly operations and the logistic support, where needed. Industry partner Voyager IP, specialists in maritime satellite and communications technologies have developed Guidelines for control and optimisation of hard/software which leverages existing technology to deliver a pooled solution for flexible data communications in a more effective and efficient manner.",
      "The SeaDataNet SWE Sensor Web Enablement toolkit as developed by 52North has been adopted and upgraded for transfer of the EARS information from RVs to shore for storage in a Data Hub at CSIC, and further distribution by means of SOS Sensor Observation Service for visualization in a dashboard on the EVIOR platform. This facilitates the transfer of cruise metadata and underway observation data from the EARS equipped research vessels to the shore while sailing. The dashboard http://eurofleets.utm.csic.es/ is integrated in EVIOR and running with data streams from several research vessels. The following image gives an illustration.",

      "Limited examples of dual handling systems for deployment through moon pool/over the side are in existence. Task 3.4 Moonpool use for deployment and recovery of research tools developed a concept design and a simulation package. The draft design incorporates the scope of supply for a dual multipurpose launch and recovery system for oceanographic research tools and equipment such as but not limited to ROVs, grabs, drop cameras and observatory components to seabed through moonpool and/or over the side was presented to the European Research Vessel Operators for feedback ahead of progressing to concept design and 3d mapping. In development of the functional system specification SEAONICS worked with the Vard Group one of the world leaders in specialized shipbuilding for the offshore market in developing detailed drawings including a new Ice breaker vessel design incorporating the moonpool and overside operations concept system design",
      "Progress has also been made on task 3.2.3  Multipurpose crane/handling system for deep water operations Outline design. Knucklejib cranes are common onboard research vessels. They are used for the loading of material, its transfer and location on the decks of the vessel. The possibility of using such cranes for the deployment of heavy equipment over the side with supports is currently being investigated. The deployment by means of two cables traction and coax and of different material steel and aramid are being explored. The multifunctionality of such cranes has the potential to reduce rigging and loading on the working deck of smaller vessels. A conceptual design and specification will be developed for a multifunction crane for handling deepwater research equipment including corers, TVGrabs, cameras and deployment of sea equipment. This task is led by CSIC, with design engineering work undertaken by FERRI SA under subcontract.",
      "Eurofleets+ is conducting investigations concerning deep sea research from vessels aiming at achieving interoperability of rigs for the deployment of different equipment, enabling installation of mobile equipment when needed, and facilitating sharing and installation of equipment across different ships. Two specific areas of research aim at increasing the capacity and interoperability for regional vessels and the third a dual mode handling system has been designed for the deployment and recovery of research tools and equipment such as ROVs, Grabs, Drop cameras and observatory components to the seabed through moonpools or/and over the side. Limited examples of dual handling systems for deployment through moon pool/ over the side are in existence and this task presents a concept design and simulation of operation to demonstrate the design and prove its fitness for purpose.",
      "A detailed review of requirements of deep water observatories, deep water moorings and deepwater research currently in use and potential future requirements including size and weights of deployed equipment, cables and landers, as well as the length and design complexity of deep water moorings was conducted, which are presented in D3.5  Review of current and future deep water requirements. European and international cooperation inputs were secured including EMSO ERIC and Ocean Networks Canada. ",
      "This type of portable winch would allow Research Vessel Operators to expand the tools used on their vessels for the deployment of instrumentation and in turn research teams extend their studies in the deep sea using mediumsized vessels. Consultation with industry partner Hampidjan supplier of fiber ropes played a key role in reduced weight of the design through expert advice on the conversion to the use of fiber ropes which allows access to greater depths and less load on the deck layout.",
      "Eurofleets+ Equipment innovations for deep sea operations from vessels focuses on improved capability for regional vessels and improving sustainability. Exploration of the deep sea is a major challenge and opportunity in marine research. Rigs and related technologies are fundamental to the study of the sea as they are essential for the deployment of equipment.",
      "Eurofleets+ includes key synergistic industry partners, Hampidjan, MacArtney and SEAONICS to enable the exploration of synergies that can be achieved through the developments in the JRA tasks related to equipment innovations for deep sea operations from vessels.",
      "The first of these, a New deepsea winch design, an electric, heave compensated portable ISO 20 winch from MacArtney suitable for use on Ocean, Global, Regional and vessels of opportunity OSV increasing capacity to work in the deepsea operations.",

      "This international Eurofleets course will expose participants to several stateoftheart ocean observing platforms available in West Sweden. Training aspects include understanding of ship and roboticbased observing techniques and their associated sensors and measurement capabilities. The course will provide ship time on two new highseas research vessels RV Skagerak and RV Svea, in addition to deployment of autonomous platforms such as gliders and larger AUVs. Participants will go to sea during the training week for instrument and platform deployments, roboticplatform piloting, to gain understanding of how different platforms collect data and through data processing and visualization, investigate which platforms are best to use for various scientific questions.",
      "The general objective of the course is to provide theoretical background and practical experience in conducting instrumental measurements of seawater physical and chemical properties, using Conductivity Temperature and Depth CTD probes, Niskin bottles for water samples collection, salinometers, and depending on weather conditions moored instruments that will be deployed near the coast as a test to learn the setup of instruments such as Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers ADCPs and Microcat probes",
      "The general objective of the course is to provide theoretical background and practical experience in the scientific understanding of marine ecosystems and the services they provide, and to use this knowledge to generate stateoftheart advice for meeting conservation, management, and sustainability goals using as a case study the Nephrops norvegicus Norway lobster.",

      "During field activities several instruments were used: Conductivity Temperature and Depth CTD probes, Niskin bottles for water samples collection, salinometers, moored instruments deployed near the coast as a test to learn the setup of instruments such as Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers ADCPs and Microcat probes. The mooring was then deployed during the first field day and recovered one day after to learn how to retrieve the collected data. The course also provided theoretical background on inherent IOPs and apparent AOPs optical properties in marine waters and how to use these measurements to observe the biology of the ocean and study the ocean carbon pump. The students had the chance to familiarise themselves with measurement and management of IOPs and AOPs acquired by autonomous robotic platforms, with a focus on BGC Argo floats. Synergies between BGC Argo data measurements and other platforms including satellite Ocean Colour were explored. During offshore activities, students were trained on testing, deployment and recovery of Argo floats. Offshore training was supported/integrated/preceded by lectures, and online resources.",

      "OASIS takes place at the SE Alboran Sea MarchApril, on board RV Pelagia, and makes use of the ROV Max Rover. The cruise proposes to revisit the unique pristine Cabliers Cold Water Coral reefs, with the following specific objectives: 1 Assess the real extent of the living Cabliers Cold Water Coral CWC reefs, quantify their biodiversity and groundtruth the exceptional biomorphologic features evident on the available finescale maps; 2Quantify, across multiple spatial scales, the oceanographic and hydrodynamic processes maintaining the northern Cabliers reefs in thriving conditions and evaluate the retroactive mechanisms with the smallscale seafloor complexity, being these processes responsible for CWC functioning; and 3 Apply and test the efficiency of smart automatic survey strategies on the reefs, contributing to define new management procedures for deepsea ecosystems.",
      "The final campaign ERODOTO will take place in June on board of RV Aegaeo. ERODOTO aims to gain a clear understanding of the mass wasting and erosive processes that regulate the headwalls retreat in the direction of the coast, happening today, in canyon headwalls and thus assess their potential geohazards to coastal areas and infrastructures. ERODOTO proposes an innovative integrated methodological approach to analyse and quantify the active dynamics of a shelfincising, closetoshore submarine canyon in order to set a model for geohazards assessment and risk management.",
      "Also on board the RV Tangaroa, in April, the VISIT campaign will take place. The aim of this cruise is to test whether alongstrike changes in the thickness, composition or physical properties of the EocenePliocene pelagic sediments on the incoming Pacific plate are responsible for the sharp, alongstrike differences in interseismic coupling and seismic behaviour observed along the Hikurangi margin and whether similar changes in sediment properties could be responsible for controlling seismic behaviour at other subduction zones.",
      "The overarching motivation of  HYDEE OBS is to move towards muchimproved estimations of gas and gas hydrate distribution and concentration in a typical active subduction margin. Estimates of the global gas hydrate reservoir vary widely as do geophysicsbased estimations of hydrate saturation at localscale gas hydrate reservoirs. The campaign will take place in March 2023 on board the RV Tangaroa.",

This will be achieved through WP9 Dissemination and Communication. Key actions include support to WP1 for the project launch, to raise awareness through a vibrant website, promotional materials, and social media. Support to WPs 2 and 4 to promote Calls for Applications and capture information from funded cruises. Research data collected during the funded cruises, and en route data will be made widely available including through remote access in line with FAIR and Open Research Data principles. This will also be applied to joint research activities WP3. Data to be protected for later exploitation will not be disseminated, through working closely with the Innovation Committee WP7. Support for WP5 for engagement of stakeholders and with WP6 for training activities. WP9 activities will continue throughout the project to ensure that decision makers are aware of the need to support a fitforpurpose Research Vessel capability in Europe, that target endusers can maximise their research opportunities, and that the public will be aware of the importance of the research fleet in marine research and the sustainability of the planet.

      "A successful TNA proposal will be integrated into the cruise planning process of the system. Within this process, the cruise is scheduled and allocated to a suitable time slot. Part of the planning process is to evaluate whether the system can operate from the proposed vessel, taking into account e.g. lifting gear, positioning possibilities or lab space. Hence, a visit to the ship within the scope of the cruise preparation is eligible in order to prepare mobilization and operation. A precruise meeting with the responsible scientists will be organized to discuss details of the cruise, operation and payload. ",
      "MARUMSquid will be operated by a trained crew with a longterm experience in ROV operation. The team will assist and support the scientific party in any ROV related matters like technical or operational issues. The team will take care of the mobilization/demobilization on the vessel with support from the ships crew, operation and repairs. Dives are possible on a daily basis but are limited to 8 hours operation time, however exceptions can be made depending on the current situation.",
      "For positioning, ROVSquid uses the Posidonia or GAPS USBL systems from IXBLUE. Due to the advanced navigational sensor package of the ROV, positioning and displacement within 10cm is possible. The system can fly along given patterns within this accuracy to create photomosaics on small scale structures such as bacterial mats.",

      "ICOS is well connected to European and global networks that are in charge of coordinating greenhouse gas observational activities or collecting and curating the data. Its voice is increasingly being acknowledged in international forums. ICOS has, for example, established a deep connection to domainwise global dataintegration efforts such as FLUXNET, SOCAT and GAW. During the past years, ICOS has become a respected and active participant in the advocacy work of climate change policy and management carried out in international organisations, such as the SBSTA of the UNFCCC. In 2019, ICOS became an observing Intergovernmental Organization to UNFCCC and organised its first official sideevent at the COP25 meeting in Madrid.",
      "ICOS has developed a broad range of standardisation protocols in order to ensure the highest observational standards for each ICOS station. One component of this standardisation for ICOS Atmosphere measurements is that the stations are centrally served with reference gases. The protocols are implemented during the ICOS station labelling process. This guarantees that all ICOS stations collect data that meet the agreedupon quality requirements. By going through the labelling procedure, the ICOS stations increase their reliability, participate in a nearrealtime NRT data flow via the Carbon Portal and benefit from the curation and dissemination of the data.",
      "ICOS is engaged in enhancing the readiness of scientific communities to tackle the current pressing climate changerelated challenges by organising science events that include, for example, a biannual ICOS Science Conference. In 2019, ICOS took the initiative of forming a drought task force to address the 2018 extreme drought event in Europe. This task force rapidly compiled relevant datasets and the analyses were discussed openly among the wider science community at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2019. The initiative will result in a special issue with 14 papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B journal.",
      "ICOS effectiveness in unifying the European climate science field has already had effects on technology and innovation. The wider the ICOS network is, the bigger its impact on technology and innovation. ICOS is a single large procurer with high demands. Its industrial partners indicate that high ICOS standards drive them to develop new or improved measurement methods and hardware innovations and to increase their product quality. Suppliers of sensors and measurement instrumentation mention that having ICOS as their client counts as a quality certificate.",
      "The ICOS Central Facilities CFs and Carbon Portal provide trainings, for example for stations Principal Investigators, managers and technicians on any necessary issues. The aim is to stimulate the better use of ICOScertified instruments and involve station staff in working groups for protocol development. Training also acts as a platform for exchanging ideas and knowledge on cuttingedge innovations and technologies related to the ICOS RI.",
      "ICOS supports its partners to apply for multidisciplinary consortium projects by providing timely information on the financial and administrative process as well as on scientific and technical prerequisites and developments. For example, ICOS partners have been very successful in getting funded by EU Horizon 2020 projects. All ongoing ICOS projects are listed in Appendices.",
      "We work actively towards European countries that are not yet part of the Research Infrastructure in order to enlarge the membership in ICOS and the coverage of the network. The larger the network, the more relevant the data collected for the global users, e.g. those involved in complex climate modeling.",

      "All landbased fixed ICOS stations submit raw data to the Thematic Centre and/or the Carbon Portal on a daily basis. The most important raw data streams are the eddy covariance flux data from Ecosystem and the Greenhouse gas concentration data from Atmosphere. For these two data streams you see here the daily updated data coverage per week from the start of the labelled status of the station until today. The graphs show the percentage of data received per week, indicated by color, where blue is 100% and dark red is 1 %.If no data at all has been received the color is white. It is normal that the last week as it is not finished yet shows some red color.",
      "Missing data can be caused by instrumental problems, failing pumps, power failures, hickups in data communication data will arrive later which will update the data coverage for the period etc. The challenge for the station responsibles is to make sure that such problems are detected, and resolved as soon as possible to guarantuee the data quality and best possible data coverage to avoid sampling biases.",

      "The STILT Footprint Tool is based on model simulations. The tool simulates atmospheric transport and upstream regions influencing the greenhouse gases at the station, creating socalled footprints. These footprints are combined with surface maps of natural and anthropogenic carbon fluxes, to trace changes in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the station. The STILT Footprint Tool displays both, the footprints as well as the concentrations of carbon dioxide at different times, in socalled timeseries. This provides a simplified approach that can be used to evaluate different measurement strategies.",
      "The current model framework consists of the Lagrangian transport model STILT Stochastic Time Inverted Lagrangian Transport; Lin et al., 2003 together with emissionsector and fueltype specific emissions from a prerelease of the EDGARv4.3 inventory ECJRC/PBL, 2015 and biospheric fluxes from the diagnostic biosphere model VPRM Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model; Mahadevan et al., 2008. The model framework has been developed at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and is implemented as a webbased service at the ICOS Carbon Portal.",
      "STILT Footprint Tool is an online tool to analyse the potential impact of natural and anthropogenic humancaused emissions on the atmospheric carbon dioxide at a selection of ICOS atmosphere stations. The tool has two parts: The STILT viewer and the STILT on demand calculator.",
      "The STILT on demand calculator can be used for running the simulation tool for any given point within Europe, and for adding the results to the datalist available in the STILT viewer for visualisation.",
      "The STILT viewer visualises the footprints calculated with the STILT model. Simulation results of several years for most ICOS stations are available in the STILT viewer.",

      "The ocean covers more than two thirds of the earth surface and absorbs approximately 25 percent of the humanoriginated carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from the air. The deep ocean stores about 60 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. Therefore, the ocean is a critical factor damping the effect of human CO2emissions. The emissions affect marine carbon cycling and consequently marine life. The increase of carbon dioxide decreases the potential of Hydrogen pH in the ocean, which will lead to ocean acidification.",
      "The network of ICOS ocean stations monitor greenhouse gases in the Atlantic and the Nordic, Baltic and Mediterranean Seas. The data collected at the ocean stations are processed and quality controlled by the Ocean Thematic Centre, which coordinates the network of ocean stations.",
